# Remembering Ian

This project was created in memorium of my uncle who had recently passed.
When exploring options for an online presence in this category, I found that a lot of the options
were dated design-wise. I took matters into my own hands in order to create a clean, minimal, and modern design
to honor my uncle in a way that would make family and friends happy!

<b>Frontend</b>: React.js, Vite.js, Tailwind CSS

<b>Backend:</b> Node.js, AWS S3

<b>Hosting:</b> Google Cloud
